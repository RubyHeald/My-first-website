        <h2>Green Ticks!</h2>

        <p class="quote">Are you chasing the green ticks? </p>
        <img src="https://cdn.vectorstock.com/i/500p/15/05/green-tick-checkmark-icon-vector-22691505.jpg" alt="Green Tick" width="50px">

        <p>Starting the Multiverse Bootcamp is a daily crash course in learning! It’s easy to become fixated on completing the modules for the sense of accomplishment that the green tick can give but its short lived when you reach the next module, and the cycle begins again. This isn’t just you, it’s the cohort working collaboratively to chase the tick also. Yes, the tick means you can move onto the endless amount of pending work, but does it mean you understand what you are trying to achieve? Ask yourself once Fridays project comes around, are you ready? Mindset plays an integral part in delivering the best version of yourself and how you apply yourself to the programme.</p>
        <p>Question – What do you want to achieve from that learning? Did you achieve it? If so, then great move onto the next task, but if you didn’t, should you really take the green tick as an accomplishment? </P
        <p>I had to reevaluate my learning style and learn to adjust myself to the content being delivered. I began asking myself the following questions:</>
        <p></p>
            <li>Does the green tick confirm I understood the assignment?</li>
        <li>Do I understand the content? </li>
        <li>Have I visited the external links for further learning?</li>
        <li>Have I made the best use of my time today? </li>
        <p>These are questions that I have begun to ask myself during week 5 of the apprenticeship. Up until now I have felt like a dear in headlights. Trying shed light on desired comprehension of the tasks (I still do) has been challenging. However, understanding your learning style and adapting it to the programme will gain a greater level of understanding from what you a learning and attempting to achieve, whether that being on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.</p>
        <p>I have learnt so much more about my learning style since starting Bootcamp. I have found that working 1-1 or within the cohort helps cement what I have learnt.</p>
